        The project uses a dataset of chest CT scans from Kaggle to help detect whether an individual has lung disease, 
        with the VGG16 model serving as the basis for training. This method suggests integrating cutting-edge neural network designs 
        to improve medical imaging diagnosis accuracy.''')
